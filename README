This efi_img_creator script is a bash script that does the following:
	- generates a raw disk image
	- partitions the image with parted: EFI boot partition + root fs partition
	- creates file systems on the partitions: vfat for the EFI boot, ext4 for the
	    root fs
	- installs Debian Jessie onto the root fs (debootstrap)
	- mounts proc, sysfs, dev
	- creates /etc/fstab, /etc/network/interfaces
	- allows root login
	- chroots into the root fs and installs a good base set of tools, including
	    the linux image and grub2 for EFI
	- generates the grub.cfg and makes modifications to ignore the loopback mount
	    and forces the use of a serial console
	- uses grub-mkstandalone to generate the grubx64.efi executable 
	- tries to unmount everything. Unfortunately, you can't unmount dev and so a
	    reboot is needed to completely unmount the loopback partitions. For this
	    reason, I highly recommend running this script in a Jessie VM.

This script was developed on a Debian Jessie VM.
Packages required on a Jessie VM in order to run this script successfully:
	- qemu
	- debootstrap
	- parted
	- dosfsutils
